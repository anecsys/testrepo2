          <h2>Feel at home in NSW</h2>
          <p>When you are studying, it is  important to have a good home base where you feel safe and relaxed.  There are many accommodation options for international students in NSW;  for example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Halls of residence or colleges:</strong> On-campus accommodation owned by your school or university</li>
            <li><strong>Private student accommodation: </strong>Purpose-built student accommodation either on-campus or within walking distance of your school</li>
            <li><strong>Private accommodation:</strong> You rent a house or apartment from a real estate agent or private landlord</li>
            <li><strong>Homestay:</strong> You stay with a family in their home</li>
            <li><strong>Boarding schools:</strong> For students up to the age of 18, some primary and high schools offer accommodation at school.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Accommodation costs</h3>
          <p>The  average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in the city centre is  currently around A$1,776 a month, and outside of the city around A$1,300  per month. This varies depending on which NSW city or region you are  studying in. The Commonwealth Government provides a breakdown of <a href="http://www.studyinaustralia.gov.au/global/live-in-australia/living-costs" target="_blank">average Australian accommodation costs for international students here </a>.</p>
          <h3>How to choose where to live</h3>
          <p>When  choosing accommodation, the most important thing is to feel secure and  happy, so you can focus on your studies and enjoy life. It is a good  idea to research all your options before making a decision.</p>
          <p>Here are some questions you should ask yourself:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What is included in the cost – for example, utility bills, telephone, internet?</li>
            <li>What are my rights and responsibilities as a tenant?</li>
            <li>What public transport options are available?</li>
            <li>How close is the accommodation to where I am studying?</li>
            <li>How safe do I feel in the area?</li>
            <li>Is the area quiet enough for sleeping and studying?</li>
            <li>How many others am I sharing with? What are they like?</li>
            <li>Am I comfortable sharing with people of a different gender?</li>
            <li>Is the accommodation furnished or unfurnished?</li>
            <li>Does the accommodation include food or meal plans?</li>
          </ul>

This allows you to prove that you did not cause damage, and therefore are entitled to have your deposit returned in full when you move out. Be sure you understand what you are signing and agreeing to.</p>

    <h2>Managing your finances</h2>
    <p>Understanding your finances,  organising a bank account and budgeting are all important parts of your  student life in New South Wales. Living on a student income can be tough  (especially if this is the first time you have lived away from home).  Here are some tips to help you take control of your finances.</p>
    <h3>The Australian currency</h3>
    <p>The  basic unit of currency is the Australian dollar (AUD or A$) and there  are 100 cents in one dollar ($1). Bank notes are plastic, brightly  coloured and issued in $5, $10, $20, $50 and $100 denominations. As for  coins, we have 5 cents (or c), 10c, 20c, 50c, $1 and $2. 1c and 2c coins  were discontinued in 1990.</p>
    <p>When paying with cash, prices of goods  and services are 'rounded up' or 'rounded down' to the nearest 5 cents.  For example, you would pay $1.95 in cash for an item priced $1.97, but  $2 for an item priced $1.99. If paying by an electronic method such as a  credit card or bank transfer, the price would not be rounded up or  down; you pay the exact amount.</p>
    <h3>Make a budget</h3>
    <p>It is a good idea to work out a weekly or monthly budget that includes all your possible income from sources such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Family support</li>
      <li>Savings</li>
      <li>Part-time work</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You  can then compare this against your weekly spend to make sure you have  enough money to live, study and enjoy your time in NSW.</p>

    <h3>Banks in NSW</h3>
    <p>There  is a diverse and competitive banking industry in Australia, and banks  are regulated by the Australian Government. Almost all Australian  residents maintain a transaction or savings account with a linked debit  or credit bankcard.</p>
    <p><strong>EFTPOS (Electronic Funds Transfer at Point of Sale): </strong>Australians  increasingly use electronic payments through EFTPOS for basic purchases  and debit payments. There is usually no charge for paying by EFTPOS;  however there may be a minimum spend, such as $10.</p>
    <p><strong>ATMs</strong> (<strong>Automatic Teller Machines): </strong>You  will find ATMs in most public places, and many education providers have  ATMs on campus. ATMs in Australia will usually charge a fee if the card  you use belongs to a different bank to that of the ATM. </p>
    <p><strong>Bank charges:</strong> All bank accounts in Australia are subject to bank charges of some kind  – ask your bank about these. However, there are many banks which offer  accounts without account keeping fees or with minimal charges.</p>
    <p><strong>Credit cards:</strong> If your credit card has a Maestro or Plus sign on the back, you will be  able to use that card in Australia. Some credit card transactions will  attract a fee, generally a percentage of the final bill (for example,  1.5%).</p>
    <p>Also, do not forget that you may be charged extra fees each  time you use a card from your home country in Australia. Some banks may  waive these fees, so it is worth investigating which banks do this.</p>
    <p><strong>Internet banking: </strong>Most banks enable you to access your account via the internet.</p>
    <p><strong>Opening an account:</strong> To open a bank account you will need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your Electronic Confirmation of Enrolment (eCoE)</li>
      <li>Your passport and other forms of identification (these vary depending on the banking institution)</li>
      <li>A letter of offer from your education provider</li>
      <li>Your Australian Tax File Number (TFN), available from the <a href="https://www.ato.gov.au/" title="Australian Tax Office" target="_blank">Australian Tax Office (ATO) </a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Opening hours:</strong> Most banks are open Monday to Friday, from 9.30am to 4.00pm (although some are also open on Saturday mornings).</p>
    <p><strong>Student accounts</strong>: Some banks offer special student accounts with no or low fees, so ask about this option.</p>
    <p><strong>Transferring money from overseas:  </strong>Money can be sent via Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) to your Australian bank account. This usually takes between 1 and 10 days.</p>
